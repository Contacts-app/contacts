A simple Contacts web application that stores information such as name, address, and telephone numbers for contacts.

To clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Contacts-app/contacts.git

Project Requirements

1- Use Python/Django framework.
2- Front-End: Develop a basic web front-end to interact with the application. Apply some styling to create a visually appealing interface.
3- Data Storage: Store contact information in a database. SQLite is suggested for simplicity.
4- API: Provide a basic API that serves the applicationâ€™s data.
5- Dynamic Interactions: Include a few examples of dynamic user interfaces, such as AJAX interactions or partial updates to the DOM. These are considered as extra features.
6- Local Environment: The application only needs to run on a local machine and does not need to be deployed as a live site.
7- The web app should allow users to:
    - see a list of contacts.
    - perform CRUD activity for contacts.
    - store name, address, telephone number, email address.

Assumptions:
1- Multiple users will be using this app, so multiple lists of contacts are needed, protected by user name/password.
2- For simplicity, no checks on password strength will be performed.
